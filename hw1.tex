\begin{questions}

\question Given $\Sigma=\{a,b\}$, list 2 members and 2 non-members of the language, $(a \cup ba \cup bb)\Sigma^*$.

\question Given $\Sigma=\{a,b\}$ and the languages, $A$ and $B$, we define the following operations.
  \begin{align*}
    n_a(w) &=  \text{the number of } a\text{s in } w, \text{ where } w\in\Sigma^*,\\
    A\smile_a B &= \{ u\in A \mid \exists v\in B \ni n_a(u) = n_a(v) \}
  \end{align*}

  Prove or disprove the following claim.
  \begin{claim}
    The class of regular languages is closed under $\smile_a$.
  \end{claim}

  
\question[5] Below is the transition table of a finite automaton. $\implies$ indicates the starting state, and $*$ indicates accepting states. Provide a regular expression for the language recognized by this automaton.
  \[
  \begin{array}{r|cc}
    & 0 & 1 \\\hline
    p & \{ q \} & \emptyset \\
    \implies q & \{ q \} & \{ q, r \} \\
    *r & \emptyset & \{ s \} \\
    *s & \emptyset & \emptyset \\
  \end{array}
  \]
  
\question
  \begin{parts}
  \part[5] Suggest regular languages $L_1$ and $L_2$ over $\{0,1\}$ such that
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $L_1\not\subseteq L_2$,
  \item $L_2\not\subseteq L_1$, and
  \item $(L_1\cup L_2)^* = L_1^* \cup L_2^*$
  \end{enumerate}
  \part[5] Prove or disprove whether condition 3 above holds for any regular languages, $L_1$ and $L_2$.
  \end{parts}

\question[5] In class, we talked about the closure of the class, $A$, of regular languages under the union, concatenation, and star operations. In this question, we want to explore whether $A$ is also closed under intersection. That is, does the following hold?
  \[
    L_1\in A \land L_2\in A \implies L_1 \cap L_2\in A
  \]

  We want to go about it as follows. The expression, $L_1 \cap L_2$, can be transformed using DeMorgan's law to an equivalent one involving union, for which closure is known, and another operation. Show whether $A$ is closed under this operation, and use your result to argue about the closure of $A$ under intersection.

\question[5] We now want to explore the closure of the class, $A$, of regular languages under the operation, $mix$, which is defined as follows.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Given strings, $u$ and $v$, both of length $n$, $mix(u,v) = u_1v_1u_2v_2\ldots u_nv_n$.
  \item Given languages, $L_1$ and $L_2$, $mix(L_1,L_2) = \{mix(u,v) \mid u\in L_1, v\in L_2, |u| = |v|\}$.
  \end{itemize}
  Is $A$ closed under $mix$? Justify your answer.
